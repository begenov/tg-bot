## steps

    Telegram Bot API: The bot will use the Telegram Bot API to interact with users. This API provides methods to send and receive messages, handle inline queries, and manage the bot's profile.

    Webhook: The bot will use a webhook to receive updates from Telegram. This will allow the bot to receive real-time updates and respond quickly to user requests.

    Bot Controller: This component will handle all incoming requests from the Telegram Bot API and route them to the appropriate handler based on the user's current state.

    User Management: This component will be responsible for managing user accounts and their associated data. It will store information such as the user's name, phone number, and selected role.

    Language Selection: The bot will prompt users to select their preferred language at the start of the conversation. This will allow the bot to communicate with users in their preferred language.

    Phone Number Verification: The bot will ask users to provide their phone number and verify it using Telegram's built-in authentication API. This will ensure that the bot has a valid phone number to contact the user if necessary.

    Role Selection: Once the user has verified their phone number, they will be prompted to select their role - job seeker or employer. Based on their selection, the bot will create a new profile for the user.

    Profile Management: The bot will allow users to view and update their profile information, such as their name, age, gender, and contact details. The user's profile will be stored in a database for easy retrieval.

    Job Posting: Employers will be able to post job openings and manage applications from job seekers. Job seekers will be able to search for job openings and apply directly through the bot.

    Resume Management: Job seekers will be able to upload their resume and manage their job applications through the bot.

    Notifications: The bot will send notifications to users when new job openings are posted or when their job application status changes.

    Natural Language Processing: The bot can use natural language processing to understand user requests and respond appropriately. This will allow users to interact with the bot in a more conversational manner.
